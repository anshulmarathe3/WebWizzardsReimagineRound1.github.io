## Introduction
Haldiram is a renowned brand that has been delighting customers with a wide range of traditional Indian sweets, snacks, and savory products for decades. As a beloved household name, Haldiram stands for quality, authenticity, and a rich culinary heritage.

The current website, while functional, does not fully capture the essence of the brand nor does it provide the seamless user experience that today’s digital consumers expect. This redesign project aims to address these gaps by creating a website that is not only visually appealing but also user-centric and technologically robust.

## Features
