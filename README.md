## Introduction
Haldiram is a renowned brand that has been delighting customers with a wide range of traditional Indian sweets, snacks, and savory products for decades. As a beloved household name, Haldiram stands for quality, authenticity, and a rich culinary heritage.

The current website, while functional, does not fully capture the essence of the brand nor does it provide the seamless user experience that todayâ€™s digital consumers expect. This redesign project aims to address these gaps by creating a website that is not only visually appealing but also user-centric and technologically robust.
